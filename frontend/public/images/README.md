# Images Directory

## Background Image

Please place your aircraft background image in this directory with the filename:

**`aircraft-background.jpg`**

The image should be:
- High resolution (recommended: 1920x1080 or larger)
- Optimized for web (compressed to reduce file size)
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP

### Image Description

The image should be of an Airbus A380 with the ANA Flying Honu livery (sea turtle design) as described in the prompt.

### Alternative Filename

If you use a different filename, update the `background-image` URL in `frontend/src/App.css` in the `.hero-background` class.

### Image Optimization

For best performance, consider:
- Using WebP format for smaller file sizes
- Compressing the image (tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
- Using multiple sizes for responsive design (optional)
